# Lazer

This is the development repository for Lazer (previously called Phaser 3).

Lazer is the next generation of the Phaser game framework. Using a completely ES6 base it is renderer agnostic, allowing for DOM, SVG, Canvas and WebGL rendering, across desktop and mobile web browsers.

You can read all about the philosophy behind Lazer [here](http://phaser.io/news/2016/01/phaser-in-2015-and-beyond).

## Mailing List

There is a Google Groups [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/phaser3-dev) you can join where progress is posted daily.

You can also follow development on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lazerjs)

## Warning: Highly Experimental

Everything in this repository is highly experimental. We're testing out all kinds of things, from ES6 features to new renderers. Unless you're part of the development team please don't open issues here _yet_.

We have no current estimated date of release.

We are asking for suggestions and feedback in [this forum thread](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread/) so be sure to add your voice.
