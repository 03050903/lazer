## Warning: Highly Experimental

Everything in this repository is highly experimental. We're testing out all kinds of things, from ES6 features to new renderers. Unless you're part of the development team please don't open issues here _yet_.

We have no current estimated date of release. But Q1 2016 is our target.

We are asking for suggestions and feedback in [this forum thread](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/7949-the-phaser-3-wishlist-thread/) so be sure to add your voice.
